# Dotfiles

Let's get a new compy set up!

Mostly optimized for macos.

To run, execute `install.sh`.

## TO DO

- [ ] https://superuser.com/questions/1627226/chrome-shortcut-to-open-new-tab-in-same-tab-group - make this a thing
- [ ] Steal more macos setup from [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos)
- [ ] disable Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use (found under Desktop and Dock in System Preferences) for amethyst
